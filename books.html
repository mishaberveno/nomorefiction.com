                <h2>Working</h2>
                <p>The way Robert Caro does research is so exhaustive that it spawned the term “Caro-esque.” In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Working-Robert-Caro/dp/0525656340" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Working</a></em>, he gives us a behind-the-scenes look into his process and vision over the past 60 years that yielded The Power Broker and The Years of Lyndon Johnson, some of the best biographies ever written. “Just remember, turn every page. Never assume anything. Turn every goddamned page.” – January 2025</p>

                <h2>Sapiens</h2>
                <p>Reading history helps us put things into perspective, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0771038518" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sapiens</a></em> by Yuval Noah Harari offers plenty of opportunities to do so while covering the last 300,000 years. This book succeeds in being informative, entertaining and opinionated — easily worth anyone’s time. “Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile contradictions, and this process fuels change.” – December 2024</p>

And that’s on top of offering an engaging story of its own. “Even if the two race-legends were like oil and alcohol in the same bottle, the bottle had not been broken yet.” – December 2024</p>

                <p>Few molecules influence our behaviour more than dopamine. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Molecule-More-Chemical-Creativity_and-Determine/dp/1948836580" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Molecule of More</a></em>, Daniel Lieberman explains how the dopamine circuit works and what we can do to avoid tilting the balance into the red. Plenty of practical and insightful examples. “From dopamine’s point of view, having things is uninteresting. It’s only getting things that matters.” – August 2024</p>

                <p>While Saramago’s slow narrative, run-on sentences, lack of punctuation, and no character names should make his books difficult to understand, he manages to do the opposite, producing authentic page-turners. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Double-Novel-Jose-Saramago/dp/0156032589" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Double</a></em> is no different. “Such is our need to shower blame on some distant entity when it is we who lack the courage to face up to what is there before us.” – August 2024</p>

                <h2>Four Thousand Weeks</h2>
                <p>As a mortality reminder, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals/dp/0735232466" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Four Thousand Weeks</a></em> by Oliver Burkeman takes a philosophical approach to getting things done, asking, “Why would you do this in the first place?” Cramming extra tasks into your to-do list makes you more anxious than productive. “Meaningful productivity comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take.” – April 2024</p>

                <h2>Getting Real</h2>
                <p>The main idea behind <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Real-Smarter-Successful-Application/dp/0578012812" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Getting Real</a></em> by Jason Fried and DHH is that creating plans, strategies, presentations, reports, and high-fidelity mockups isn’t work. Work is dealing with something real — copy, code, customers, and other variables that bring the project to the market. “Scope down. It’s better to make half a product than a half-assed product.” – December 2023</p>

And don’t those questions apply to everything? “It wasn’t him and at the same time it was, like a ghost from a separate timeline.” – December 2023</p>

It’s a book of depth, puzzles and hidden references, but also of playfulness, humour and disregard for the rules. Skip the annotated version but keep a dictionary nearby. And persevere. “When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once.” – November 2023</p>

                <h2>Sourdough</h2>
                <p>In his books, Robin Sloan brings together sci-fi mysteries, boyish nerdiness and San Francisco Bay tech culture. And <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sourdough-Bonus-Story-Suitcase-Clone/dp/1250869692" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sourdough</a></em> is no exception. The novel touches on what it means to do meaningful work and how to be part of a community you cherish. It’s a light and straightforward story. “A thing I believe about people my age: we are the children of Hogwarts, we just want to be sorted.” – February 2023</p>

                <p>According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and his seminal book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/dp/0061339202" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flow</a></em>, if you want to enjoy your work, you need to immerse yourself deeper within it. Happiness, it seems, is an aftermath of absolute concentration and intense exertion of your mental or physical abilities. “It’s by being fully involved with every detail of our lives that we find happiness.” – September 2021</p>

                <h2>The Divide</h2>
                <p>What differentiates rich countries from poor ones is <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Divide-Global-Inequality-Conquest-Markets/dp/0393651363" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Divide</a></em> — an ever-increasing gap intentionally orchestrated by the West to suck out resources from the global South. Jason Hickel will change your perspective on inequality and unravel the myth of third-world development. “Poor countries don’t need our aid; they need us to stop impoverishing them.” – March 2020</p>

                <p>For years I was recommended Ted Chiang as a genius of short-form sci-fi writing.

                <p>Out of all the media, comics seem to be the most misunderstood, often written off as a step before actual art and literature.

                <h2>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</h2>
                <p>If you read enough Tolstoy, you’d think that exploring universal feelings of fear, regret, redemption and hatred is his pastime. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Death-Ivan-Ilyich-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0307951332" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a></em>, he takes on the ever-present question of the meaning of life. Witty, in spots even mind-reading, novella urges everyone to stop and reflect on their path, whether young or old or nearing deathbed. – January 2018</p>

                <p>Frank Chimero talks about design as a play between the creator, the creation and the audience. His <em><a href="https://buyolympia.com/Item/frank-chimero-the-shape-of-design-paperback" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Shape of Design</a></em> is a definite inquiry into the why of creativity. “If an artist or designer understands the objective, he can move in the right direction, even if there are missteps along the way. But if those objectives are left unaddressed, he may find himself chasing his own tail.” – January 2018</p>

I reluctantly picked up a copy of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition/dp/1591396190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blue Ocean Strategy</a></em>, solely because it came up in many conversations. While not the best business book, it didn’t disappoint, providing some new approaches to value creation, “align the whole system of a firm’s activities in pursuit of differentiation and low cost.” – January 2017</p>

                <h2>Invisible Cities</h2>
                <p>Travelling, we perceive cities differently. But none of us have the ability to express them in such imaginative, eloquent and engaging way as Italo Calvino. In his masterpiece, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Invisible-Cities-Harvest-Hbj-Book/dp/B00SQCAXD8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Invisible Cities</a></em>, he writes “divide cities into those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.” – January 2017</p>

                <h2>Zero to One</h2>
                <p>A revered business book this year — <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0804139296" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zero to One</a></em> by PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel. I was wary about reading it — after all, what reading yet another business revelation can do? But the book gave form to an idea I’ve had in the back of my head for a long time: every person has the potential to become a monopoly in something. – November 2015</p>

                <h2>Later Short Stories</h2>
                <p>Anton Chekhov is renown for his ability to bring light to the most nuanced aspects of personal relationships. And his <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0679603166" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Later Short Stories</a></em> from the 1888–1903 period go even deeper and explore even further, observing what it is that makes us human. “…Before I loved, I myself also perfectly knew what love is.” – November 2015</p>

                <h2>Anything You Want</h2>
                <p>“No ‘yes.’ Either ‘hell yeah!’ or ‘no’” is one of many quotes from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00SI0B5FS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anything You Want</a></em>that I wrote down. It’s a heuristic for evaluating commitments, intended to free up your time. The moment you pick this manifesto up, you realize that Derek Sivers lives by unique rules. And throughout the book he is making it clear — you don’t have to live the life you don’t want to live. – October 2015</p>

                <p>There’s a widespread perception that yoga is an ancient tradition, that asanas are distilled through thousands of years of Indian wisdom. Mark Singleton, relying on written accounts of various yoga teachers and travellers in his <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0195395344" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yoga Body</a></em> discovers how in fact modern yoga was influenced, among other things, by European gymnastics and the emergence of bodybuilding. – August 2015</p>

                <p>So much written about WWII, yet it’s rare to find a true perspective of a soldier. Most of the ones who fought were killed; those who survived not willing to recall. Nikulin was the latter, although he did eventually write down what he went through to “get rid of oppressive thoughts.” After 25 years of gathering dust, <em><a href="http://www.imwerden.info/belousenko/books/nikulin/nikulin_vojna.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recollections of the War</a></em> was published to share his nightmares. – July 2015</p>

His on-point wit and unconventional views in <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Design Is a Job</a></em> are worth writing down. “I’m not trying to make a connection between art and design.
