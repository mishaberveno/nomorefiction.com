        <p>I can’t remember anything.</p>
        
        <p>I don’t remember what I looked like as a kid. I don’t remember my parents when they were young. I don’t remember how I got to school, or which school it was. I don’t remember my teachers or classmates. Don’t remember the games I used to play.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I close my eyes and try to visualize my youth. I see a few blurry shapes. A few blurry shapes, and nothing more.</p>

        <p>I don’t remember being rebellious as a teenager. I don’t remember trying alcohol, cigarettes or weed. I don’t remember falling in love or having sex for the first time. I don’t remember my friends. Don’t remember what I used to do.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I see someone from my past, and they tell me something we used to laugh about. I smile, but I don’t remember the meaning of those jokes anymore.</p>

        <p>I don’t remember my high school graduation. I don’t remember applying for university. I don’t even know which degree I got, and it doesn’t matter because I don’t remember learning anything.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I get birthday wishes from numbers I don’t recognize, sharing stories from another life. I reply with a quick thank you and go about my day. I have no idea who these people are.</p>

        <p>I don’t remember my first real job, or even the city it was in. I don’t remember my boss or coworkers. I don’t remember how much money I used to make. I don’t remember the apartment I rented or how it looked. Don’t remember the girlfriend who lived with me then.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I read a book and have a visceral reaction, as if it actually happened to me. Sometimes I even internalize the story and accept it as my own. <em>What’s the difference between truth and fiction?</em></p>

        <p>I don’t remember getting married. I don’t remember getting divorced. If I have kids, I don’t know who they are because they don’t live with me. I don’t remember my parents dying. Don’t remember how many siblings I’ve got or where they are.</p>

        <p>You might think that my life is devoid of meaning, but it’s not true.</p>

        <p>While I envy people who can call on their memories at any time, my own memories are of a different kind. They are lived. Even though I can’t bring up images in my mind, my body remembers the experience.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I feel the pain, and I know it’s coming from my past. I get heartaches. I walk somewhere, and the sharp sensation of nostalgia flushes through me. I don’t have memories, but I hear the echo of my memories every day.</p>

        <p>My body remembers the experience, even if it’s inaccessible to my own consciousness. Everything I’ve lived through has left an imprint. I don’t dwell on the past — I can’t. Instead, I live in the moment, trying to do my best with what I’ve got. Really, I think life is pretty good now.</p>

        <p><em>Does it matter that we don’t remember if we got the lesson anyway?</em></p>
