        <p>It was around 11:30 pm when Monika called, waking me up from a deep slumber.</p>
        
        <p>“Can you come? I need you here.”</p>
        
        <p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
        
        <p>My chest tightened. She never called. I got up and walked to the bathroom to wash my face. Pausing before the mirror, I noticed a few grey hairs in my stubble. My eyes looked tired.</p>
        
        <p>I put on black jeans, a t-shirt, a pair of distressed leather boots, drank a glass of water and walked out the door. A pleasantly cool breeze embraced me as I headed to her neighbourhood.</p>
        
        <p>She was outside, as beautiful as ever, wearing a green cocktail dress that reminded me of summer days long past. Her lively ever-curious eyes locked onto mine. She took my hand and led me up the street.</p>
        
        <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
        
        <p>We walked a couple of blocks in silence. Then she turned her head as if to check whether I was still there. She smiled and my heart sank. Some things you never get over.</p>
        
        <p>I thought of her often. Accidentally for the most part. It doesn’t take much to trigger a memory: a date on a calendar, a street corner, a phrase said by a friend, the colour of a stranger’s hair. You tend to remember the good. The bad fades away.</p>
        
        <p>She turned into an alley. There was a bar we used to go to a lot. That night, it was packed, smoky and loud. A band was playing. As we passed through the crowd, someone I knew tapped my shoulder. The adjacent room was quieter, and we sat at the bar.</p>
        
        <p>“Two vodkas, please.”</p>
        
        <p>The bartender put two shots on the counter. She downed hers. Then took mine and downed it as well.</p>
        
        <p>“So what is this about?”</p>
        
        <p>She paused. The light above the bar illuminated her face — enchanting, but not mine anymore.</p>
        
        <p>“I still love you.”</p>
        
        <p>I woke up to the trill of a ringing phone and found myself on the couch in the living room, with a book on my chest. Must have fallen asleep reading. I saw the phone and picked it up. It was her.</p>
        
        <p>“Can you come? I need you here.”</p>
        
        <p>“No.”</p>
